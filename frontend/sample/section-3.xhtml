						<h2>Section 3 - Test Heading</h2>
						<p>
							Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
							have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by
							this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the
							great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this
							vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to
							save us from ourselves.[footnote:fn-1-0] <a href="#fig-1-0"
								class="figure-link">fig-1-0</a> <a href="#fig-1-1"
								class="figure-link">fig-1-1</a>
						</p>
						<p>I am a stranger. I come in peace. Take me to your leader and
							there will be a massive reward for you in eternity.</p>
						<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.
							There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our
							species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or
							not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>
						<p>The view of the Earth from the Moon fascinated me—a small
							disk, 240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that little
							thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging
							nationalistic interests, famines, wars, pestilence don't show from
							that distance.</p>
						<p>
							Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
							everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
							every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The
							aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident
							religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and
							forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
							civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
							every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
							every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every
							"superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the
							history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in
							a sunbeam. <a href="#fig-1-2" class="figure-link">fig-1-2</a>
						</p>
						<h3>Another Test Heading</h3>
						<p>It's just mind-blowingly awesome. I apologize, and I wish I
							was more articulate, but it's hard to be articulate when your
							mind's blown—but in a very good way.</p>
						<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.
							Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and
							emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the
							momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless
							cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel
							on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner,
							how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill
							one another, how fervent their hatreds.</p>
						<p>First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to
							achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on
							the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space
							project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more
							important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will
							be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.</p>
						<p>A good rule for rocket experimenters to follow is this:
							always assume that it will explode.</p>
						<p>The vehicle explodes, literally explodes, off the pad. The
							simulator shakes you a little bit, but the actual liftoff shakes
							your entire body and soul.</p>
						<p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in
							this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy,
							but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to
							organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because
							that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
							unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the
							others, too.</p>
						<p>From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two
							words: 'Tough' and 'Competent.' Tough means we are forever
							accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never
							again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into
							Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we
							will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short
							in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be
							perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your
							office and the first thing you will do there is to write 'Tough
							and Competent' on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each
							day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the
							price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the
							price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.</p>
						<p>I saw for the first time the earth's shape. I could easily
							see the shores of continents, islands, great rivers, folds of the
							terrain, large bodies of water. The horizon is dark blue, smoothly
							turning to black. . . the feelings which filled me I can express
							with one word—joy.</p>
						<p>The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human
							understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is
							our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human
							concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is
							young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last
							few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected
							discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations
							that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have
							evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is
							prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends powerfully
							on how well we understand this Cosmos in which we float like a
							mote of dust in the morning sky.</p>
						<p>Let's light this fire one more time, Mike, and witness this
							great nation at its best.</p>
						<p>Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase.
							The autotargeting was taking us right into a ... crater, with a
							large number of big boulders and rocks ... and it required ...
							flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good
							area.</p>
						<p>The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely
							with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered
							charcoal, to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small
							fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the
							footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy
							particles. There seems to be no difficult in moving around, as we
							suspected.</p>
						<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and
							character-building experience. There is perhaps no better
							demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant
							image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility
							to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish
							the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</p>
						<p>That's one small step for [a] man; one giant leap for
							mankind.</p>
